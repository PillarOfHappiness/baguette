## FINAL PROJECT TOPIC: 
Ever wondered which Stephen King villain you were? Well, wonder no more. Enter your name and year of birth to see which one of Stephen King's natorious villain lurks inside you.

## HOW IT WORKS
Depending on the name you have inputed, the program will output a different villain based on your guys' name match percentage. However, the year you have inputted will limit the range of villain's names being checked with yours. The program does this simply by checking to see if your year is even or odd. Thus, which ever villain's name matches with the one you inputted the most in the year's outputted range will be selected.
